It is true that there is a cat in the room, and her perception gives her strong justification for this belief. However, suppose Alice's vision is such that she only sees the cat due to a rare coincidence; had the lighting been different, she would not have seen the cat at all. Intuitively, we would judge that Alice does have knowledge of the cat\u2019s presence, despite the fact that her belief was easily falsified under slightly different conditions.}, {There is a plausible principle that knowing requires not just true belief, but also a \u2018safety\u2019 condition, meaning that under nearby possible circumstances, the belief could not easily have been false. This principle together with the aforementioned case entails that Alice's justified true belief does not meet the safety condition, challenging the idea that safety is necessary for knowledge.}",
