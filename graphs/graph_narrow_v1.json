    "content": "This view posits that for someone to know a proposition, three conditions must be satisfied: the belief must be true, the person must believe it, and the person must have justified reasons or evidence for that belief. Each component is essential; if any condition fails, then the knowledge claim is deemed invalid. The truth condition ensures that one cannot know things that are false. The belief condition indicates that knowledge cannot exist without a person's conscious acceptance of the truth of the proposition. The justification condition requires that there be adequate support for the belief, making it based on evidence or reason rather than mere guessing or luck. Consequently, in any scenario, if a person holds a belief that is false, lacks justification, or does not accept the truth of the belief, then according to this view, they do not possess knowledge.",

For example, an individual might have strong evidence supporting a belief about a scientific phenomenon based on current understanding, only to later discover that the evidence was misleading or that the phenomenon was poorly understood.

By downplaying the role of individual reasoning or evidence, reliable process epistemology risks overlooking the subjective aspects of knowledge that contribute to its legitimacy.
