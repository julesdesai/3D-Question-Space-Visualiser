    "content": "In cases of honest mistakes or good faith errors, individuals may claim knowledge based on faulty evidence, yet they are not deliberately attempting to mislead. This raises questions about how the view navigates the boundary between incorrect knowledge claims and those that are genuinely held with the intent to know, suggesting a potential oversight in its treatment of the moral dimensions of knowledge.",

This objection invites a consideration of whether a more pluralistic approach might better account for the diverse manifestations of knowledge.",
