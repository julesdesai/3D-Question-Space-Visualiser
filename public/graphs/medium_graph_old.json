The justification means that there must be good reasons or evidence behind the belief, which makes one confident that it is true. If any of these three components are lacking\u2014if the belief is not true, if the individual does not hold it as true, or if the belief is not properly justified\u2014then it cannot be considered knowledge.

      "content": "This objection questions the view by pointing out that people often share knowledge and understanding across diverse contexts, suggesting that there must be some underlying invariant quality to knowledge that transcends specific contexts. For instance, individuals from varying cultural or social backgrounds can often reach common conclusions or understandings based on the same facts or evidence. This raises concerns about the assertion that knowledge is solely shaped by contextual meanings, as it implies that some level of universal understanding exists, which may contradict the idea that knowledge is entirely dependent on context.",

For example, in a legal setting, the interpretation of a statute may differ from its interpretation in a moral or philosophical discussion. If knowledge varies dramatically based on context, it leads to difficulties in establishing a coherent understanding of what knowledge is, as conflicting contexts may produce conflicting knowledge claims, challenging the reliability and unity of knowledge itself.",

For example, two distinct cultural groups might have different fundamental beliefs about the nature of reality based on their social practices. If knowledge is determined by social constructs, then it raises the question of how to adjudicate between these conflicting beliefs.

Individuals often assess, challenge, and refine social beliefs through personal reflection and logic. This suggests that knowledge requires more than just social agreement; it also necessitates a critical, rational process that can lead to different conclusions even in the face of collective beliefs.

Critics contend that certain truths or facts must be recognized as constant and reliable, rather than contingent on individual experiences or a subjective understanding of the world.
